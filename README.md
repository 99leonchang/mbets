# McConnell Brue Economic Terms Search (MBETS)
JavaScript program for searching through the glossary terms of the McConnell Brue Economics textbook. This script uses the Semantic UI search function, which does real-time searching of the terms index.
Linking to other economic terms from within the definition is supported, however, due to errors in the word index, it is unreliable.
This program was made to simplify searching for economics words. Any fixes or improvements are appreciated.

Word list is largely derived from [awendland's project](https://github.com/awendland/mcconnell-brue-economics-terms) with some formatting and linguistic modifications.
